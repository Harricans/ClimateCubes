                <p>Climate Cubes is a unique collection of visualizations depicting the impact of
                    climate change on Earth. Through these NFTs, we aim to raise awareness of the climate crisis and
                    showcase the consequences of inaction.</p>
                <p>Our goal is to challenge the notion that blockchain
                    technology has a negative environmental impact by demonstrating that NFTs can be environmentally
                    responsible.</p>
                <p>We are committed to ensuring that the entire project, including all secondary market
                    transactions, is carbon offset. Additionally, we will invest in renewable energy and reforestation
                    to achieve 100% carbon neutrality.</p>
                <p>Our team is dedicated to delivering ongoing value to Climate

                <h2>Random generation</h2>
                <p>
                    The Climate Cubes algorithm is unique among NFT collections. It utilizes a random seed, akin to
                    Minecraft, to determine the characteristics of the base planet. This seed also generates a human
                    society
                    with cities and power plants, including renewable options.</p>
                <p>Using a complex procedural generation system,
                    it carefully analyzes and places various elements across the 8192 tiles. The algorithm considers
                    24
                    environmental factors, 10 types of pollution, 9 biomes, and over 40 individual buildings.</p>
                <p>It
                    calculates
                    the impact of pollution, such as greenhouse gases, global warming, deforestation, and
                    desertification,
                    while determining the appropriate level of destruction and its visual representation.</p>

                <p>The planet consists of 8,192 tiles, each generated with a variety
                    of 40+ elements, including palm trees and oil rigs.</p>
                <p>Next, the planet's temperature, biomes, and historical human impact are determined by factors such
                    as pollution, greenhouse gases, and global warming.</p>
                <p>The result is an entirely unique depiction of an alternative outcome to the current climate crisis.

                <p>The Climate Cubes NFT collection utilizes a diverse range of over 40 design elements to populate each
                    planet. These elements include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cities</li>
                    <li>Trees</li>

                    <li>Nuclear plants</li>
                    <li>Solar panels</li>
                    <li>Wind turbines</li>
                    <li>Oil rigs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The algorithm carefully selects these elements based on more than 20 variables, such as the planet's
                    temperature, water level, and energy consumption.</p>
